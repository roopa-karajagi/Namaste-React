why we use css frameworks and libraries like (bootstrap,tawlind,material Ui) etc
--> TO write optimize css
--> It saves time writing lot of features
--> faster development
--> to maintain consistency in building UI
--> the job of processing inline css is heavey that is the one reason to use frameworks


inline css in react

const stylecss = {
    background-color:red;
}
style ={to write js we use curly braces (stylecss)};
style={{object to write css}} --> outside curly braces stands for js to write

ways to write css
inline css
external css
scss
styled components
bootstrap framework
component libraries --> material UI , ant design,chakra,base Ui etc..
tailwind CSS framework

cons of using libraries

1) Increase in bundle size
2) Forced to use default structure of libraries, lot of pain to write customize css of compoenent

Will learn and use tailwind frameworks

Pros of tailwind css frameworks
1) Css on the go(in the same file)
2)reusability
3)less bundle size
4)Flexible UI(control over customization)


postcssrc --> it is telling parcel to compile tailwind css into normal css , so that parcel can know that we are using talwind in our files that is the reason we use postcssrc

COns:

Non readable
learning curve is little difficult
so much of classes to add in one html page
