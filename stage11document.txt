Props drilling --> passing the props from parent to multiple  child components and using it, is called props drilling.

Cons of props drilling
unnecessary of code
unnecessary of componenet rendering bcz of props

Lifting the state up --> passing the state from child to parent

UI layer and Data layer

UI Layer and Data layer work together to get the better user experience

UI layer(View , core js , what we write in code, at the end of the day HTML , css what we see on UI page)
Data Layer(passing data to components , states,props, context , API everything about data what we use for manipulation and to view on )
Context: 
context is kind of useState for all around the application
context is central state(central data storage) for application...

data managament is all about managing state , props and context etc...

in class based components we use like below
<UserContext.Consumer>
{({user})=> <h4>{user.name} </h4>}
</UserContext.Consumer>

we use Context API to avoid Props drilling
