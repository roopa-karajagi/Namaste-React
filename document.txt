/***
   *Local variables are not prefered in react , bcz to modify and maintain the variable we need react variable
  * const searchTxt = "KFC"; -- this is Normal variable declaration , but if i  add this to input , i can't change the input value

  <input type="text" name="searchTxt" placeholder="searc" /> --> it works in HTML but not in react

   * In html if i just write input we can write/change the value but in react it doesn't happens
   * this is one example where html is different than React

   * In react we need to ***bind*** the value to the Field and change the input text

   * e --> synthetic event , has all the info regarding on change element
   * local variables are not preffered in React
   * if we need to maintain a variable , then we need to use React variable.
   * that is State (local variable in react, which we can update/change the value)
   *  
   * we need to do a data binding in react in the application to update the variable to work
   * State: useState() Hook --> to maintain a local variable we need state in react
   * useState : these state is created using useState Hook , to create local state variable

   * useState returns an array ==> [first element is variable , function to update the variable]
   * 
   * destructuring of the value
   * const searchValue =  useState()
   * const [searchVal , setSearchVal] = searchValue;
   * 
   * reading and writing the state at the same time and that is called 2 way binding.
   * 
   * react will not re-render the application to display it on UI when there is change in the local variable , so react needs state to render application and display it on UI and react will track these  variable
   * Hooks: it is normal function , but it has specific functions for it

   React uses one way data binding --> to change the input on UI
   * 
   * 
   * var searchTxt ='KFC'
   * <input
            type="text"
            className="search-input"
            name="searchTxt"
            placeholder="Search...."
            value={searchTxt}
            onChange={(e) => console.log(e)}
          />

   *

   Hooks is just normal function --> it has specific function 
   useState --> it will create state variable
   useState comes from react and it is used as Named Import --> developed by FB developers
